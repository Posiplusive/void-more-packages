## linux-zen for Void Linux

Currently, only configs for x86_64 are shipped in this repo. If you want configs for i386 and/or arm64, feel free to let me know.

Lists of configuration applied:
- Uses the BMQ CPU scheduler by default
- CONFIG_MNATIVE_INTEL set to y. It is recommended that you change the option based on what CPU you have right now.
